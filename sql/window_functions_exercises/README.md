# 1 - Business Problem
Curry Company is a tech business app that connects restaurants, delivery personnel, and end users. The app allows users to order food, which will be delivered to their homes by a delivery person.

The company serves as a bridge between restaurants, delivery personnel, and end users, generating data on the types of orders, weather conditions, delivery ratings, etc. As the company is experiencing rapid growth, the CEO lacks a strategic view or key performance indicators (KPIs) to make informed decisions. To address this problem, as a data analyst, my role is to understand the business and create data-driven solutions that provide insights to the CEO, enabling better decision-making regarding the company's future.

The enterprise is classified as a marketplace involving three focal points as mentioned earlier (restaurants, delivery personnel, and end users). Consequently, the CEO wants to see KPIs and insights regarding these three focal points.
