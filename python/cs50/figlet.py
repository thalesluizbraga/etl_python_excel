# FIGlet, named after Frank, Ian, and Glenâ€™s letters, is a program from the early 1990s for making large letters out of ordinary text, a form of ASCII art:

 # _ _ _          _   _     _
# | (_) | _____  | |_| |__ (_)___
# | | | |/ / _ \ | __| '_ \| / __|
# | | |   <  __/ | |_| | | | \__ \
# |_|_|_|\_\___|  \__|_| |_|_|___/

# Among the fonts supported by FIGlet are those at figlet.org/examples.html.
 
# FIGlet has since been ported to Python as a module called pyfiglet.
 
# In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:
 
# Expects zero or two command-line arguments:
# Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
# Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or 
# --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
# Prompts the user for a str of text.
# Outputs that text in the desired font.
# If the user provides two command-line arguments and the first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of
# a font, the program should exit via sys.exit with an error message.
