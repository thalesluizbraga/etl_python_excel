# Suppose that a machine sells bottles of Coca-Cola (Coke) for 50 cents and only accepts coins in these denominations:
# 25 cents, 10 cents, and 5 cents.
 
# In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time
# informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in 
# change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an
# accepted denomination.
